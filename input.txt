Comparisonvalue2: For most working parents, no other issue is so fraught with worry as the choice of child care. In a field long plagued by overheated headlines and complicated political overtones, three new studies offer some solid information on the pros and cons of different arrangements.Two bolster research that found that long hours in group child care are linked to better reading and math skills but worse social skills and more behavioral problems. The third suggests that children in child care centers are safer than those who receive care in private homes, whether in a neighbor's home or by a nanny in the child's own home.Four years ago, the nation's most ambitious and longest-running child care study sparked a firestorm with its findings that 4 1/2-year-olds who had spent more than 30 hours a week in child care were more demanding, more aggressive and more noncompliant than others, regardless of the type or quality of care, the family's socioeconomic status or the sensitivity of the mother's parenting.Now a new report from that research -- the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Study of Early Child Care -- has tracked the same children through early elementary school and found that by third grade, those who had spent long hours in child care continued to score higher in math and reading skills and that their higher likelihood of aggressive behavior had dissipated. But it also found that they still had poorer work habits and social skills.Researchers cautioned that the findings should not be a cause of alarm, since the effects of child care were found to be small."It isn't that these kids are more likely to have clinical levels of behavior problems," said Jeanne Brooks-Gunn, a professor of child development at Columbia University. "You're getting a slight uptick, but it's still in the normal range."Generally, the effects of child care were much smaller than the effects of good or bad parenting."Virtually across the board, the effects of parenting are greater than the effects of child care, so some people might say we don't need to worry about the small effects of child care," said Cathryn Booth-LaForce of the University of Washington, a researcher on the study."But child care affects so many children that for society at large, even small effects are important," Professor Booth-LaForce added. "We have to consider whether we're creating a generation of children who have slightly less self-control, slightly more behavior problems, and whether teachers will have to spend a little more time on classroom management and a little less on instruction."A separate study, being released today and based on a nationally representative sample of more than 14,000 kindergartners, found that while center-based day care programs modestly benefited middle-class children in early language and mathematics learning, youngsters from poor families experienced double those gains."Compared to many homes, preschool centers are richer settings in terms of enriched language, reading and math," said Bruce Fuller, a co-author of this report, "The Influence of Preschool Centers on Children's Development Nationwide: How Much Is Too Much?"The report, by sociologists at Stanford and the University of California, found that cognitive skills in prereading and math were strongest when children entered a center-based program from age 2 to 3.But it also found that on average, the earlier a child enters center-based care, the slower the pace of social development. The greatest effect was among high-income children. Youngsters who were from families with income of at least $66,000 and who spent more than 30 hours a week in center-based care had the weakest social skills -- including diminished levels of cooperation, sharing and motivated engagement in classroom tasks, along with greater aggression -- compared with similar children who remained at home with a parent.Another study, being published today in The American Sociological Review, is apparently the first broad research into safety in child care. It found that the rate of death among children receiving care in private homes was 16 times that of children in child care centers."Fatalities are the tip of the iceberg, and they're fortunately very rare, but they do reveal something about what goes on in centers," said Julia Wrigley, a sociologist and acting associate provost at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, who wrote the report with Joanna Dreby. "No one kind of child care is clearly and definitely better for all children, but in terms of safety there are advantages in centers."Infants are by far the most vulnerable children in care, Professor Wrigley found, and most often die from being shaken, usually by a caregiver stressed by constant crying. In a database she put together from state records, legal cases and news reports covering 1989 to 2003, she found 203 shaken-baby deaths in care in a private home and not a single one in a child care center.It was a shaken-baby death that prompted her project."I was on the Phil Donahue show talking about a book I'd written on the relationship between parents and the caregivers they hire in their home, and another woman on at the same time had a baby who was shaken to death by the nanny," Professor Wrigley said. "As a sociologist, that got me thinking that with eight million kids in paid child care every day, there must be some safety data out there somewhere. But there wasn't."Professor Wrigley found that the risks of injury and sexual abuse were both highest in family day care -- a usually informal arrangement in which several children receive care together in a private home -- while child care centers had the highest rate of near-miss incidents, as when a child wandered off onto a highway, for instance, or was left in a van.Some child care experts said the latest research should help define the next generation of studies."We really need to begin to look more carefully at what is going on among the children in child care," said Deborah A. Phillips, a professor of psychology at Georgetown University. "It may be that we're not doing a good job of training teachers on peer relationships, on how you foster cooperation and empathy."Most of all, Professor Phillips said, negative findings on child care should serve as a call to action."Child care is the fraught issue for parents," she said. "But I think the story here is when we are going to stop wringing our hands and start assuring better child care choices for parents."
