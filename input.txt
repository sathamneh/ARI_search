Comparisonvalue2:The witch happens to be Melanie Neer, 50, a student of the principles of Wicca and Harry Potter.
The evil intention happens to be an eviction order from her landlord, who has long complained about the intense cat odor coming from the apartment. 
Although it is against Wiccan principles to put a harmful spell upon others, Ms. Neer said as she took out a special candle used for ""super-duper protection spells,"" one may cast a boomerang spell on a harmful person to so that the harm comes back to him. 
But while she has managed to stave off eviction thus far, the witchcraft is not working wonders on the cat front.
