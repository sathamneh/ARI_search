    public static String textToLookFor = "FAME won in quite a different XfieldX of strenuous endeavor assures Georges XCarpentierX, the French XpugilistX, of one element of success as a film artist. His mere appearance in a \"walking-on\" part would probably XattractX a large proportion of the hosts of his admirers. In \"The Pathetic Symphony,\" however, he goes far beyond any such perfunctory show; he is the principal actor in a long and compiex story, and is the central figure in almost every scene in which he appears.The rather extravagant but picturesque story is inspired by the famous symphony of Tchaikovsky, which largely supplies the accompaniment and, in the effective scene which forms the climax, really heightens the tragic emotion in a remarkable way. Paul Roland, a young Frenchman of good society, falls in love with the daughter of a Moroccan chief, and obtains her father's consent to the marriage. The girl's uncle, who has a racial hatred of Europeans, carries her off in order to prevent the union. The kidnapping is a violent affair, and affords a glimpse of the original Carpentier in a single-handed, two-minute round with half a dozen of the kidnappers. During this scene Paul's friend Marks (Henry Krauss) is playing a pianoforte transcription of the Pathetic Symphony, and it is one of the ideas of the author that, by a series of fatal coincidences, the performance of the symphony should be intimately associated with all the critical episodes of the story.Returning to France, the young Paul attracts, without reciprocating it, the affection of Mrs. Arwood, an American widow. Escaping from her toils, he marries Beatrice Hamitton, in spite of Mrs. Arwood's melodramatic and highly colored attempts (she does not stop short of murder) to prevent him.From the promise of happiness in the gardens of the Riviera, Paul is suddenly summoned by his old love, a note being delivered to him from the Moroccan girl Zetzaia, who informs him that she is being kept prisoner in her uncle's fortress in the African desert. Yielding to passionate impulse, Paul forsakes his wife, flies across the Mediterranean in an airplane, lands in the desert, scales the rocks to reach the fortress and rescues the girl. These scenes, in which M. Carpentier's athletic figure is seen in adventurous activity, are the best in the film and there is a really well-managed thrill in the last-minute escape of the young couple in the airplane, which picks them up in front of the pursuing Arab horsemen. The happiness of Paul and Zetzaia is, however, dogged by the fatality which fastened upon it at the beginning. The girl dies from the shock of learning from Mrs. Arwood that Paul is already married.For all this tragic disturbance there is at last a compensation; through the unconscious mediation of their little son Paul and Beatrice are reconciled and the story glides to the quiet conclusion of assured married happiness. There is some good acting, the best being that of the musician. Marks. M. Carpentior could hardly be expected to have the range or the subtlety of emotional expression of the supreme actor and there are scenes in which he has to bear a difficult comparison with the sparkle of his partners, but he photographs well and makes a brave figure in the episodes of adventure.More African Backgrounds.CURIOUSLY enough, two other films which have recently been shown in Paris give us African pictures, and one of them. \"L'Occident,\" presents a story of the reaction of East and West in contact. It is based on a novel of Henry Kistemaeckers, produced for the screen by M. Henri Fescourt. The production is on a scale worthy of the technical equipment of the Cinéromans de France. At the beginning there are fine photographs of French warships in action and some of the strect scenes are excellent. One or two social ceremonies are shown in colors and perhaps gain in splendor on that account, but they would gain more still if the colors were natural. The story is of the love of Hassina, daughter of a Moroccan chief, and Lieutenant Cadière, who lands from his ship to get information for the fleet about the position of an army of rebel tribesmen. Disguised as a native chief, Cadière succeeds in making his notes and sketches. He is, however, bitten by a snake and is near to death when he is discovered by Hassina. She conceals him, nurses him back to health and carries his precious notes to the French naval force which has been put ashore from the fleet. Cadière takes the girl to France—to the Riviera—and it is understood that she will become his wife. Here a shadow falls across their path. Hassina's little sister, Fathima, has been carried off by the rebel chief Taieb, who knows of Hassina's betrayal of him and seeks vengeance with Oriental cunning and persistence. He sows in Hassina's mind the suspicion that Cadière has killed her sister. At the same time a brother-officer of Cadière falls in love with the girl. He persuades the distracted young woman to run away with him and this project is on the point of being carried out when Fathima is discovered performing, under the cruel persecution of Taieb, as a dancer in the low sailors' haunts in the ports. Cadière saves his fellow-officer from the disgrace of desertion and wins back in full measure the love of Hassina. As the heroine of the piece Claudia Victrix is entirely sympathetic; her acting is full of delicate nuances. The outstanding portrait among the other persons in the film is the Taieb of M. de Bagratide, a decidedly clever sketch.A \"Literary\" Film.L'EAU DU NIL\" is a film made out of the interesting novel of M. Pierre Frondaie. It has something of the usual defect of the \"literary\" film in that its action is determined by the structure of the novel and not thought out directly and spontaneously for the cinema. Two qualities make the picture notable—the exquisite voyage up the Nile, with remarkable photographs of Luxor, Karnak and Assouan, and the striking impersonation of the banker. Wirsoq, given by Maxudian.Wirsoq, who belongs to the type of cosmopolitan financier, gets into his power a young French aristocrat. Arthur de Sorgepois, and insists that the boy's sister. Anne-Marie, should marry him. The girl is in love with a young artist. Pierre Levannier, who secretly returns her affection, but does not declare himself at this critical moment because he is not rich enough to support a wife. So Aune-Marie is sacrificed and enters into a luxurious but loveless existence. Chance brings Pierre and the girl together again at Cairo. The flame of passion revives and the two young people snatch from fate an idyll of a few weeks.Wirsoq, uneasy in Paris, sends a message which finds them in the midst of their dream at Assouan and Anne-Marie rejoins her husband at Cairo. Forced to a choice, she finally resists the pleading of Pierre and elects to remain with the husband imposed on ker by her family. In despair, Pierre exposes himself to sunstroke in the desert and dies. Anne-Marie returns to France to mourn her vanished dream. Lee Parry and Jean Murat play the two lovers charmingly, but the clou of the acting is Maxudian's vivid portrait of the complex personality of Wirsoq. The film is accompanied by some rather experimental examples of the talking film produced by the Gaumont, Petersen and Poulsen processes, the first to be shown in Paris.Raquel Meller.THE piquant personality and accomplished art of Raquel Meller find appropriate expression in \"La Venenosa,\" a film adapted from the Spanish novel of J. M. Carretero by M. Roger Lion. She is Miss Liana, a trapeze artist at the Cirque d'Hiver. An air of mystery floats about her, and it is whispered that she is fated to spread misfortune because, in her infancy, she was bitten by a sacred serpent in India. The legend is supported by a series of tragic events. An artist who takes her place at a performance one night falls and is killed. An animal tamer who is in love with her meets a horrible death. She marries an Indian Prince, but on the night after the impressive wedding ceremony he is drowned at sea. Finally, in the brilliant setting of the baccarat room at Ostend, she meets Luis de Seville, a man with whom she had had one brief encounter in picturesque circumstances years before. She had actually given her blood for a transfusion operation to save his life. A strange memory of Luis had ever since haunted her and now she realizes that he is the only man she has really loved. With this meeting also ends the legend, for in a vision Miss Liana sees the death of the sacred serpent which was the origin of all her fatal and involuntary power for causing misfortune, and she knows she can safely give her hand to the man she loves. The picture gives a series of brilliant seenes and the right kind of color for the exercise of Raquel Meller's peculiar gifts.";
