Jimmy, who attends the gifted program at Naranja Elementary, is the only student assigned to that stop at the corner of Southwest 232nd Street and 162nd Avenue.\nThat worried his parents, said Jimmy's older brother, Ted. They had been pressuring the school system to let off their son at their driveway, because the bus drives past their house anyway.\n   \"I guess now they're going to do something about it,\" said Ted, 18, fighting tears.\n   For two days, Metro-Dade police have combed the Redlands area near the missing boy's home. Dozens of officers, aided by dogs and helicopters, swarmed the area. The FBI opened a kidnapping investigation and joined them, with 20 agents in the field interviewing family and neighbors.\n   Still, the case has not been ruled a kidnapping, and police say there are no leads.\n   \"We know that Jimmy would not get into a stranger's car,\" said Pat Ronemous, Jimmy's aunt. \"He would have run toward the house. He would have to have been forced into a car.\"\n   More than 100 neighbors, from parents to retirees to local business owners, gathered at an elementary school on Wednesday to help search the pastures and woods around the community.\n   Others passed out some of the 30,000 fliers that had been printed in English and Spanish, the cost covered by local printers and neighbors.\n   Brenda Fowler still waved leaflets bearing Jimmy's picture at passing motorists, even though it was growing dark and she had been there since 10:30 a.m. She stood near Jimmy's bus stop, where a homemade sign lettered on plywood had been posted: Please help find Jimmy. Please pray.\n   \"It could be your kid,\" Fowler said. \"It could be my kid.\"\n   Jimmy could have been anyone's kid. Neighbors described him as a happy, sweet child who loved playing chess and baseball.\n   Both Donald and Claudine Ryce, Jimmy's parents, are lawyers; Donald is in private practice and Claudine, who is not licensed to practice in Florida, helps her husband. Samuel James Ryce is the youngest of their three children.\n   While the couple remained secluded with police Wednesday evening, Donald Ryce issued a printed statement to the media camped in front of their ornate security gate, now festooned with yellow ribbons. \"We'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for their help and support,\" he wrote. \"We just ask them to focus on any information about Jimmy.\"\n   Police will continue their search today.\n   \"It's very disappointing that we don't have stronger leads that point in one direction - whether it be kidnapping or foul play,\" said Patrick Brickman, a Metro-Dade police spokesman. Police confess they are stumped by this case. Jimmy appears to be a normal boy from a normal family, they say.\n   The Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services has no record of complaints against the boy's family, said Evelio Torres, administrative assistant for the HRS district office serving Dade and Monroe counties.\n   And no witnesses have come forward. Liz Mindermann pulled into her driveway near the bus stop about the same time Jimmy would have gotten off the school bus. She remembers a light drizzle, but nothing else.\n   \"All you can do is have faith and hope,\" she said. \"You can't think that he's dead. I won't think like that.\"\n   Anyone with information on Jimmy Ryce should call Metro-Dade police at 471-8477.

Never touch an electrical appliance, any wiring or a tool while standing in water. Be careful not to further weaken your home while removing debris.\n\nOpen all doors and windows to release moisture, odors and dangerous gases.

    public static String s4 = "\nWhen getting your damaged house back to normal, take your time. Getting injured or making a bad decision out of haste will make a difficult situation worse. Here are some tips on how to keep you and your family safe:\n-- If your home looks unsafe, it probably is unsafe. Emergency-management officials have plans to certify structures for safety after a hurricane, and it is wise to wait for them.\n-- Assessing damage on your own requires the right gear, including dry, rubber-soled shoes; rubber gloves or work gloves; hammer; screwdriver; pencil; and note paper.\n-- Walk slowly around your home, looking for big problems such as whether your home shifted on its slab. Your roof, even if it looks intact, may have shifted, too. Such problems require professional repair.\n-- As you go inside the house, open all doors and windows to release moisture, odors and dangerous gases. If you smell gas, turn it off at the meter or tank. Do not smoke or use an open flame.\n-- Beware of loose wires and sagging walls, roofs and ceilings. Be careful not to further weaken your home while removing debris.\n-- Never touch an electrical appliance or tool while standing in a pool of water.\n-- Brace walls where necessary with 2-by-4 studs.\n-- If the walls of a wood-frame home are waterlogged, drill or punch \"weep holes\" in interior walls to let water out and speed the drying process.\n-- If you have wood floors that buckled, don't try to straighten them until they've dried. Then, take up the flooring and fasten it back down evenly. It can be a difficult, exacting job, and some flooring may need to be replaced altogether; you may need a professional. If you have ceramic or terrazzo tile on top of concrete flooring, let the floor dry, then reattach any loose tiles with appropriate cement or fastener. This job, too, may be best left to a professional.\n-- Remember, make only temporary repairs necessary to prevent further damage. If you can, photograph the damage before you make stopgap repairs, and keep all receipts. Don't make permanent repairs until your insurance agent inspects the property.\nRATING THE ROOF\n-- Do not inspect anything at night. Wait until daylight, and even then have a good flashlight handy.\n-- From inside the house, look skyward to detect holes where water can get in. Make note of those areas, so you know where to make exterior repairs.\n-- Use extreme caution - and wear rubber-soled shoes - if you decide to step onto the roof. Do not walk around up there any more than you must; roofs that appear intact could have been weakened during a hurricane.\n-- Look for missing asphalt roof shingles, and missing or broken roof tiles. On flat roofs, look for areas where the gravel surface and underlayment has been torn away. Inspect roof supports, ridge areas, gable ends and eaves.\n-- In the attic, step only on wooden roof supports. If you step elsewhere, you could fall through the ceiling. Watch out for live electrical wires, jagged wood.\n-- Broken roof supports in the attic can be repaired temporarily by running 8-foot (or longer) 2-by-4's on each side of a broken support, and nailing them to the broken support.\n-- Protect your home from further damage by fixing roof leaks, or hiring someone to make emergency repairs. Emergency repairs to leaky roofs can be made with \"sneaky paper,\" which comes in rolls and has a self-adhesive side that sticks to the roof. Plastic sheeting, such as Visqueen, can also be used to stop leaks. Plastic sheeting should be at least 6 mils thick.\n-- Roofing paper is applied by alternating layers of trowel-grade roof cement and paper. Apply layers from the lowest part of the roof to the top.\n-- Remember to keep receipts for everything you buy; that will help ensure that your insurance claim gets paid.";
